# Library

## Introduction
This project is a simple Library Management System implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add books to their virtual library, mark them as read or not read, and delete them from the library.

## Features
1. **Adding Books:** Users can add new books to their library by entering the book's title, author, and number of pages through a user-friendly form interface.
2. **Displaying Books:** The added books are displayed as cards in the library section, showing their title, author, and number of pages.
3. **Marking Books:** Each book card has a "READ" button that users can click to toggle between marking the book as read or not read. The button's color changes to indicate the read status.
4. **Deleting Books:** Users can delete books from their library by clicking on the "DELETE" button on the respective book card.
